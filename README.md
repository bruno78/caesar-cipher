# Caesar Cipher

This is a very old way of encrypting messages for more information on Caesar Cipher,
go to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

This program was created on Ruby version 2.0.0

This program allows you:

* Encrypt by offsetting to any value you want.

* Whenever encounters a character non existent on alphabet,
it doesn't give you any errors.

* I'v also included a decipher method.

####### About the decipher method ######

I've created the decipher method based on the search for the most common words. So
it's far from being perfect.

I still need to perfect. Perhaps using the linux dictionary?

######## To do list ########

* make sure it *downcase* the string to make sure all the words gets to be ciphered or
deciphered

* create a method to offset numbers as well!

* find a way to use a word dictionary instead of common words to decipher
